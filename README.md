# Paroli

Paroli is a Snapchat-like Android app that I am currently working on as part of my explorations with the Android SDK. It will become a spin-off of the app built at Treehouse's [Build a Self-Destructing Message Android App](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/build-a-selfdestructing-message-android-app). My version of the app will include additional features, such as sending regular text messages and user profiles, once it is done. Stay tuned!
